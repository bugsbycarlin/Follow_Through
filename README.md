# Follow_Through
Simple productivity program


# About
Follow Through is a simple productivity program that lets you keep track of eight ongoing things by means of cute little health bars that you can fill when you want, which each decay on an adjustable N-day schedule. You can use it to make sure you're keeping up with daily tasks, doing some weekly activity that you like but forget, or getting to your projects every few days.


# Code
This program is developed in javascript with PixiJS and a few other small libraries, on top of a game engine used for several PixiJS javascript games. The build system is Electron. Feel free to email bugsby dot carlin at his gmail account for a deeper description.
